💼 My Experience（新版）
⭐ Senior Data Science Analyst — Cathay Life Insurance

Nov 2019 – Present

As a Senior Data Science Analyst, I lead machine learning and AI initiatives across claims analytics, fraud detection, OCR automation, and LLM-based decision support. I design and deliver full-cycle AI solutions — from data preparation and modeling to SHAP explainability, deployment, and monitoring — with strong alignment to business and regulatory requirements.

Key Contributions

Developed fraud detection models, risk scoring systems, and graph-network analyses to identify suspicious claim patterns.

Designed SHAP-based explainability for model governance and regulatory compliance.

Led OCR POC collaborations with external startups, improving extraction accuracy for medical invoices and certificates.

Built LLM-powered multi-agent workflows for claims reasoning by integrating business rules, vector search, and API orchestration.

Researched and implemented GraphRAG for the company’s internal LLM assistant to enhance retrieval precision.

Served as Product Manager for the enterprise LLM Employee Assistant, defining roadmap and coordinating cross-department rollout.

Delivered complete ML lifecycle: data → modeling → evaluation → CI/CD → monitoring.

👤 About Me

I am a data science professional dedicated to building intelligent systems that solve real operational challenges. My work focuses on integrating machine learning, large language models, graph-based reasoning, and automation to improve efficiency and strengthen risk control in highly regulated industries.

I have hands-on experience developing fraud detection models, OCR pipelines, multi-agent decision systems, and GraphRAG retrieval architectures — and successfully deploying them into production environments. I enjoy partnering with IT teams, business operations, actuaries, and medical experts to translate complex domain logic into scalable AI workflows.

With a hybrid background across data science, LLM engineering, and product management, I aim to create AI solutions that are technically robust, explainable, and truly impactful for end users.

🚧 My Projects
01 — Multi-Agent Claims Decision Assistant

An LLM-based system using multiple agents, vector search, and business rules to support claims analysts with automated reasoning and case evaluation.
Impact: Reduced manual review time and improved consistency in decision-making.

02 — Medical OCR Pipeline (Startup Collaboration)

A POC with external startups to build OCR solutions for medical invoices and certificates. Combined deep-learning OCR with structured rule extraction to enhance downstream claims processing.
Impact: Significantly increased structured field accuracy and reduced manual data entry workload.

03 — Fraud Detection Graph Network Model

A graph-based ML model analyzing connections among claims, hospitals, and policyholders to detect abnormal behavior clusters.
Impact: Improved early fraud detection and strengthened risk-control operations.

04 — Employee LLM Assistant (GraphRAG + Agent Workflow)

An enterprise LLM assistant integrating GraphRAG retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and internal knowledge systems for high-accuracy information support.
Impact: Enabled faster, more accurate retrieval of complex information for employees.
