💼 My Experience
⭐ Senior Data Science Analyst — Cathay Life Insurance

Nov 2019 – Present

As a Senior Data Science Analyst, I lead machine learning and AI development across claims analytics, fraud detection, OCR automation, and LLM-based decision support. My responsibilities include end-to-end model development, SHAP explainability, CI/CD deployment, and GraphRAG-based knowledge systems.

Key contributions:

Developed fraud detection models, risk scoring systems, and graph-network analysis for suspicious claims patterns.

Built SHAP explainability for regulatory alignment and model transparency.

Led OCR POC collaborations with startups, improving extraction accuracy for medical invoices and certificates.

Designed LLM-powered multi-agent workflows for claims reasoning, integrating rule-based logic, vector search, and API orchestration.

Researched and implemented GraphRAG for the company’s internal LLM assistant, enhancing retrieval quality.

Served as Product Manager for the corporate LLM Employee Assistant, managing roadmap, design, and cross-department rollout.

Delivered complete ML lifecycle: data → modeling → evaluation → CI/CD deployment → monitoring.

👤 About Me

I am a data science professional passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real business problems. My work focuses on combining machine learning, large language models, graph-based reasoning, and automation to improve operational efficiency and risk control in highly regulated industries.

I have hands-on experience building fraud detection models, OCR pipelines, multi-agent systems, and GraphRAG retrieval architectures, and delivering these solutions into production. I enjoy working closely with IT teams, business operations, actuaries, and medical experts to transform complex domain logic into scalable AI workflows.

With a hybrid background across data science, LLM engineering, and product management, I aim to create AI solutions that are technically sound, explainable, and truly impactful for end users.

🚧 My Projects
01 — Multi-Agent Claims Decision Assistant

An intelligent LLM-based system that uses multiple agents, vector search, and business rules to assist claims analysts with automated reasoning and case evaluation.
Impact: Reduced manual review time and improved consistency in decision-making.

02 — Medical OCR Pipeline (Startup Collaboration)

A POC project with external startups to build OCR models for medical invoices and certificates. Leveraged deep-learning OCR and rule extraction to improve data quality for downstream claims processing.
Impact: Significantly increased structured field extraction accuracy and reduced manual data entry.

03 — Fraud Detection Graph Network Model

Graph-based ML model for detecting suspicious clusters across claims, hospitals, and policyholders. Uses network relationships to identify abnormal behavior patterns.
Impact: Enhanced early fraud detection capability and supported risk-control operations.

04 — Employee LLM Assistant (GraphRAG + Agent Workflow)

An enterprise LLM assistant integrating GraphRAG retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and internal knowledge systems for high-accuracy information support.
Impact: Enabled employees to retrieve complex information more efficiently with increased accuracy.
